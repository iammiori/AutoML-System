# Oboe

In an orchestra, the oboe plays an initial note which the other instruments use to tune to the right frequency before the performance begins; this package, Oboe, is an automated machine learning/model selection system that uses collaborative filtering to find good models for supervised learning tasks within a user-specified time limit. Further hyperparameter tuning can be performed afterwards.

Oboe is based on matrix factorization and classical experiment design. For a complete description, refer to our paper at KDD 2019: [OBOE: Collaborative Filtering for AutoML Model Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03233).

This system is still under developement and subjects to change.
